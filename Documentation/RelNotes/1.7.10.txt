Git v1.7.10 Release Notes
=========================

Updates since v1.7.9
--------------------

UI, Workflows & Features

 * Improved handling of views, labels and branches in git-p4 (in contrib).

 * Updated command line arguments completion script for zsh (in contrib).

 * "vcs-svn"/"svn-fe" learned to read dumps with svn-deltas and
   support incremental imports.

 * "git am" learned to pass "-b" option to underlying "git mailinfo", so
   that bracketed string other than "PATCH" at the beginning can be kept.

 * "git clone" learned "--single-branch" option to limit cloning to a
   single branch (surprise!).

 * "git clone" learned to detach the HEAD in the resulting repository
   when the source repository's HEAD does not point to a branch.

 * The commands in the "git diff" family and "git apply --stat" that
   count the number of files changed and the number of lines
   inserted/deleted have been updated to match the output from
   "diffstat".  This also opens the door to i18n this line.

 * When showing a patch while ignoring whitespace changes, the context
   lines are taken from the postimage, in order to make it easier to
   view the output.

 * "git merge" in an interactive session learned to spawn the editor
   by default to let the user edit the auto-generated merge message,
   to encourage people to explain their merges better. Legacy scripts
   can export MERGE_AUTOEDIT=no to retain the historical behaviour.

 * "gitweb" allows intermediate entries in the directory hierarchy
   that leads to a projects to be clicked, which in turn shows the
   list of projects inside that directory.

Performance

 * During "git upload-pack" in respose to "git fetch", unnecessary calls
   to parse_object() have been eliminated, to help performance in
   repositories with excessive number of refs.

Internal Implementation

 * Recursive call chains in "git index-pack" to deal with long delta
   chains have been flattened, to reduce the stack footprint.

 * Use of add_extra_ref() API is slowly getting removed, to make it
   possible to cleanly restructure the overall refs API.

 * The test suite supports the new "test_pause" helper function.

 * t/Makefile is adjusted to prevent newer versions of GNU make from
   running tests in seemingly random order.

Also contains minor documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v1.7.9
------------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v1.7.9 in the maintenance
releases are contained in this release (see release notes to them for
details).

 * The error message emitted when we see an empty loose object was
   not phrased correctly.
   (merge 33e42de mm/empty-loose-error-message later to maint).

 * "git commit" refused to create a commit when entries added with
   "add -N" remained in the index, without telling Git what their content
   in the next commit should be. We should have created the commit without
   these paths.
   (merge 3f6d56d jc/maint-commit-ignore-i-t-a later to maint).

 * Search box in "gitweb" did not accept non-ASCII characters correctly.
   (merge 84d9e2d jn/gitweb-search-utf-8 later to maint).

 * The code to ask for password did not fall back to the terminal
   input when GIT_ASKPASS is set but does not work (e.g. lack of X
   with GUI askpass helper).
   (merge 84d7273 jk/prompt-fallback-to-tty later to maint).

 * map_user() was not rewriting its output correctly, which resulted
   in the user visible symptom that "git blame -e" sometimes showed
   excess '>' at the end of email addresses.
   (merge f026358 jc/maint-mailmap-output later to maint).

 * "checkout -b" did not allow switching out of an unborn branch.
   (merge abe1998 jc/checkout-out-of-unborn later to maint).
